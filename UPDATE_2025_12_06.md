# Update - December 6, 2025

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Navigation Bar Text Warping Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: Navigation bar items (Code, AI Chat, Topics, Tips) had skewed/warped text rendering
- **Root Cause**: The `.tab-btn span` CSS was using `display: flex` which caused text to be treated as a flex container, leading to visual distortion
- **Solution**: Changed `display: flex` to `display: inline-block` and removed unnecessary flex properties (`align-items`, `gap`)
- **File Modified**: `index.html` (lines 325-331)

### 2. **Updated .gitignore to Prevent Information Leaks** 🔒
- **Problem**: Unnecessary markdown files containing sensitive information and deployment details were being pushed to GitHub
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive list of markdown files to `.gitignore`:
  - `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md`
  - `5_POSTS_UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md`
  - `FINAL_VERIFICATION.md`
  - `GITHUB_ACTIONS_VERIFICATION.md`
  - `POSTING_SCHEDULE.md`
  - `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` (already excluded)
  - `URGENT_TOKEN_REVOCATION.md` (already excluded)
  - `BEFORE_AFTER_COMPARISON.md` (already excluded)

### 3. **Cleaned Up Git Repository** 🧹
- **Action**: Removed previously tracked unnecessary markdown files from git history
- **Files Removed from Tracking**:
  - `BEFORE_AFTER_COMPARISON.md`
  - `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md`
  - `FINAL_VERIFICATION.md`
  - `POSTING_SCHEDULE.md`
- **Files Still Tracked** (Essential Documentation):
  - ✅ `README.md`
  - ✅ `SETUP_GUIDE.md`

## 📊 Git Commits

### Commit 1: `03b996a`
```
Fix navigation bar text warping and update .gitignore

- Fixed text warping/skewing issue in navigation bar by changing display from flex to inline-block
- Updated .gitignore to exclude unnecessary markdown files (security reports, deployment summaries, etc.)
- Only README.md and SETUP_GUIDE.md will be tracked going forward
```

### Commit 2: `3fc4714`
```
Remove unnecessary markdown files from tracking

- Removed BEFORE_AFTER_COMPARISON.md, DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md, FINAL_VERIFICATION.md, and POSTING_SCHEDULE.md from git tracking
- These files are now in .gitignore to prevent sensitive information leaks
- Only README.md and SETUP_GUIDE.md remain tracked
```

## 🚀 Deployment Status

Both commits have been successfully pushed to GitHub repository:
- **Repository**: `kreggscode/Telegram-AI-Coding-Channel-Bot`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Status**: ✅ Up to date

## 🎨 Visual Fix Details

### Before:
- Navigation bar text appeared warped/skewed
- Text rendering was inconsistent across different buttons

### After:
- Clean, crisp text rendering
- Consistent appearance across all navigation items
- Better mobile compatibility

## 🔐 Security Improvements

- **Reduced Attack Surface**: No longer exposing internal documentation and deployment details
- **Clean Repository**: Only essential files are tracked
- **Future-Proof**: `.gitignore` configured to automatically exclude sensitive markdown files

## ✅ Verification

Run these commands to verify:
```bash
# Check tracked markdown files (should only show README.md and SETUP_GUIDE.md)
git ls-files "*.md"

# Check git status
git status

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -5
```

## 📝 Notes

- All local markdown files remain intact on your machine
- They are simply not tracked by git anymore
- Future markdown files matching the patterns in `.gitignore` will be automatically excluded
- The mini app (`index.html`) is now fully functional with fixed navigation
